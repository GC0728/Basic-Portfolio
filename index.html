                My coding journey started from humble beginnings. I used to be the fly on the wall as my friends would
                codespeak for hours.
                I would hear them say words such as "array" and "object" and be completely lost. This would go on for
                what felt like hours
                at a time. I would look around to the other people conversing with us who also neither understood what
                was being said and together
                all of us would just stare with a blank look on our face as we were simultaneously shaking our heads.
                You could say that my journey
                to learn how to write a programming language began with a desire to have a conversation with the people
                that I considered my friends.

                    Prior to immersing myself in the ways of Code Fu I worked as a Paralegal. Working as a Paralegal, I've acquired skills that will mold me into 
                    a web developer that is client-focused and quality-focused.
